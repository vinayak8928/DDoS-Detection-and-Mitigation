# DDoS-Detection-and-Mitigation
Detection using entropy and mitigation using PoW based puzzle on mininet environmnet.

Developed an efficient strategy to detect and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attacks in Software Defined Networks (SDN). The strategy involved employing IP filtering using Access Control Lists (ACL) rules, fusion entropy, and proofof-work-based computational puzzles. Implemented and demonstrated the strategy in the Mininet emulator, achieving accurate detection and effective mitigation of DDoS attacks.

To run the following code, follow the simple steps

1. Turn on the pox controller
2. Create and run the topolology
3. Perform an attack on the server
4. Logs of attack will be displayed in the pox cobtroller terminal
5. Solve the puzzle once the puzzle is issued.
